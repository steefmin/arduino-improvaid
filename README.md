# Improvaid modules
Software for the wrist, master and slave modules developed during the Living Technology Project Semester at Saxion. 

## Master

## Slave

Tested on Arduino Uno and Nano. Uses 433MHz receiver and transmitter pair (http://www.hackerstore.nl/Artikel/99). Most of the functions used are imported from the VirtualWire library (https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_VirtualWire.html). 

RF transmissions are based of the arduino-RFchat program (https://github.com/steefmin/arduino-RFchat)
